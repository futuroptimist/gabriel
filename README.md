# Gabriel

Gabriel is an open source "guardian angel" LLM aimed at helping individuals securely navigate the digital world. The project intends to provide actionable security advice, maintain personal knowledge about the user's environment (with their consent), and eventually offer local AI-assisted monitoring. Our guiding principle is to keep user data private and handle AI inference locally via [token.place](https://github.com/futuroptimist/token.place).

## Goals

- Offer community-first, dignity-focused security guidance.
- Integrate with token.place to run LLMs locally, avoiding cloud exfiltration.
- Encourage cross-project collaboration with [dspace](https://github.com/democratizedspace/dspace), [f2clipboard](https://github.com/futuroptimist/f2clipboard), and similar efforts.
- Provide a gentle on-ramp toward eventual real-world monitoring capabilities.

## Roadmap

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for a more detailed roadmap. Early milestones include:

1. Establishing repository guidelines and a base documentation structure.
2. Collecting security best practices for self-hosted services.
3. Prototyping local LLM inference through token.place.
