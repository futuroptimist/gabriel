# Flywheel Risk Model

This document outlines potential risks and mitigations when applying the **flywheel** approach to the Gabriel project. Gabriel acts as a "productive Worry-as-a-Service" (WaaS) assistant that helps users secure their digital lives. The flywheel repo proposes a continuous improvement loop where automated agents generate new tasks and code. While powerful, this model introduces security and governance concerns.

## First-order Effects

- **Increased automation** – Automated agents may alter code or configuration rapidly, raising the risk of introducing security flaws or unwanted behavior.
- **Expanded data collection** – To fuel improvements, agents might request more user data, potentially clashing with Gabriel's privacy-first goals.
- **Model misbehavior** – LLM-generated code or advice can be inaccurate or harmful if prompts are poorly scoped.
- **Third-party integrations** – External APIs expand the attack surface and may leak information if not secured.
- **Complex dependency graph** – Adding features can lead to dependency creep and plugin overload.
- **Data sensitivity** – Logs or stored information may expose secrets if not encrypted or access controlled.
- **Resource usage** – Continual monitoring could strain CPU/GPU resources and degrade user experience.
- **Complex configuration** – More settings increase the chance of misconfiguration.

## Second-order Effects

- **User overreliance** – Delegating too much security judgment to Gabriel creates a single point of failure.
- **Erosion of privacy norms** – Continuous monitoring may normalize intrusive data collection.
- **Dual use concerns** – Tools intended for self-help could be repurposed for surveillance or other unethical applications.
- **Malicious adaptation** – Attackers might learn to exploit or repurpose the flywheel's behaviors.
- **Centralization of knowledge** – Packaged distributions and update servers could become high-value targets.
- **Maintenance burden** – Rapid agent-driven changes may outpace manual reviews.
- **Ecosystem coupling** – Tight integration with other projects (e.g., token.place, sigma) could amplify upstream vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Strict Review Gates**
   - Require human review for any agent-generated pull requests.
   - Use automated linting and security scans (`flake8`, `bandit`) as a baseline.
2. **Data Minimization & Opt-In Collection**
   - Limit what telemetry or logs agents can access.
   - Seek explicit user consent and document retention policies.
3. **Transparent Logging and Change Tracking**
   - Keep audit logs of automated actions and summarize them in a changelog.
   - Reference risk assessments when major features ship.
4. **Local-First and Modular Design**
   - Favor offline or encrypted inference and allow users to enable only the components they trust.
   - Provide safe configuration templates and examples of encrypted storage.
5. **Dependency Audits and Signed Releases**
   - Track dependencies in `requirements.txt` and run periodic vulnerability scans.
   - Sign releases and maintain clear update channels so users can verify integrity.
6. **Community Review and Cleanup**
   - Encourage peer review of new modules and periodic code cleanup to limit complexity.
   - Document hardware requirements and fallback modes for low-resource environments.

This risk model will evolve as the project grows. Contributors should update this document whenever the flywheel approach expands or new integrations are added.
