## Current Snapshot (2025-09-24)

- **Status:** âœ… (as of the Futuroptimist related projects rollup)
- **Focus:** Retro-futurist idle sim (@v3) where quests teach real-world hobbies with NPC guides.
- **Deployment:** Designed to run offline so your base keeps growing without an internet signal.

## Checklist
