# futuroptimist Threat Model

The `futuroptimist` repository orchestrates reproducible pipelines, datasets, and release assets
for the broader Futuroptimist ecosystem.

## Current Snapshot (2025-09-24)

- **Workload mix:** Data processing scripts, media asset preparation, and CI pipelines supporting
  recurring YouTube episodes.
- **Interdependencies:** Serves as the coordination hub that kicks off jobs across `flywheel`,
  `token.place`, `gabriel`, and other repositories.

## Security Assumptions

- Pipelines run on managed infrastructure with restricted access to API keys and content assets.
- Contributors follow flywheel-style CI practices with mandatory linting and tests.

## Potential Risks

- Pipeline secrets (API keys, storage credentials) could leak through misconfigured CI or logs.
- Data artifacts might contain personally identifiable information from volunteers or collaborators.
- Cross-repo automation may trigger cascading failures if access tokens are over-permissioned.
