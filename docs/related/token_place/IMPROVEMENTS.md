# Token.place Security Improvement Suggestions

This document summarizes potential enhancements for the `token.place` project based on our analysis
of its architecture and threat model. The goal is to strengthen relay and server node security while
preserving the privacy-first design.

## Current Snapshot (2025-10-08)

- **Status:** âœ… Roster entry refreshed 2025-10-08 after the "Restore zero-auth relay behavior"
  release train (PR #424) landed.
- **Stack:** FastAPI + Python 3.12 services, signed relay binaries, a TypeScript/Electron desktop
  client, and Playwright-backed test suites, all glued together by Makefile tooling and GitHub
  Actions.
- **Conventions:** Prompts live in `docs/prompts/codex/`, config artifacts moved into
  `config/` (including signing keys and k8s charts), and tests span crypto helpers, API v1/v2, and
  visual regression baselines.
- **Security delta:** Zero-auth relay access returned with explicit signing checks, rate limiting,
  and moderation toggles; CI now layers CodeQL, secret scanning, and desktop build jobs to guard the
  broadened footprint.
- **Watchlist:** Keep an eye on the new content moderation hooks, crypto dependencies
  (`cryptography`, `pynacl`, `tweetnacl`), and Electron auto-update paths introduced alongside the
  desktop bundler.

## Recommended Improvements

- **Rate limiting and authentication**
  - Prevent denial-of-service and Sybil attacks by enforcing per-client rate limits.
  - Require relay and server nodes to authenticate before joining the network.
- **Key rotation and signing**
  - Implement regular key rotation for relay and server certificates.
  - Sign relay binaries so clients can verify integrity before connecting.
- **Content moderation hooks**
  - Provide optional server-side hooks for filtering malicious prompts or responses after
    decryption.
  - Document best practices for keeping moderation logic separate from relay code to preserve
    privacy.
- **Environment-aware logging**
  - Disable verbose logs in production and strip connection metadata where possible.
  - Offer an audit mode that can be enabled temporarily for debugging incidents.
- **External security review**
  - Engage third-party auditors to review the protocol and codebase.
  - Publish findings and follow up with patches to maintain community trust.

These recommendations build on the existing security log in the `token.place` repository and aim to
mitigate relay compromise, malicious server nodes, and network-level attacks.
