# Token.place Security Improvement Suggestions

This document summarizes potential enhancements for the `token.place` project based on our analysis of its architecture and threat model. The goal is to strengthen relay and server node security while preserving the privacy-first design.

## Current Snapshot (2025-09-24)

- **Status:** âœ… in the Futuroptimist related project feed
- **Focus:** Secure peer-to-peer generative AI network using ephemeral, encrypted tokens so
  volunteers can share idle compute without account creation.
- **Key components:** Relay nodes, server nodes, and lightweight clients (web + CLI).

## Recommended Improvements

- **Rate limiting and authentication**
  - Prevent denial-of-service and Sybil attacks by enforcing per-client rate limits.
  - Require relay and server nodes to authenticate before joining the network.
- **Key rotation and signing**
  - Implement regular key rotation for relay and server certificates.
  - Sign relay binaries so clients can verify integrity before connecting.
- **Content moderation hooks**
  - Provide optional server-side hooks for filtering malicious prompts or responses after decryption.
  - Document best practices for keeping moderation logic separate from relay code to preserve privacy.
- **Environment-aware logging**
  - Disable verbose logs in production and strip connection metadata where possible.
  - Offer an audit mode that can be enabled temporarily for debugging incidents.
- **External security review**
  - Engage third-party auditors to review the protocol and codebase.
  - Publish findings and follow up with patches to maintain community trust.

These recommendations build on the existing security log in the `token.place` repository and aim to mitigate relay compromise, malicious server nodes, and network-level attacks.
