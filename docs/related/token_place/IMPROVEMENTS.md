# Token.place Security Improvement Suggestions

This document summarizes potential enhancements for the `token.place` project based on our analysis
of its architecture and threat model. The goal is to strengthen relay and server node security while
preserving the privacy-first design.

## Current Snapshot (2025-10-18)

- **Status:** âœ… on the Futuroptimist related projects roster (2025-10-18 23:02 UTC snapshot).
- **Stack:** FastAPI- and asyncio-driven Python services, a freshly added TypeScript client harness,
  and Electron desktop bundles orchestrated with Makefiles and GitHub Actions.
- **Conventions:** Prompts stay under `docs/prompts/codex/`, outages under `outages/`, and tests now
  span crypto compatibility, REST routes, and the alias-aware desktop harness.
- **Security delta:** PR #464 introduced a TypeScript client for alias integrations plus expansive
  documentation, increasing supply-chain surface (desktop `package.json`, additional Dockerfiles)
  while keeping crypto primitives untouched.
- **Watchlist:** Monitor the new Node/Electron dependencies for CVEs, revalidate signing paths for the
  desktop releases, and keep an eye on provider registry updates in `config/server_providers.yaml`.

## Recommended Improvements

- Rate limiting and authentication
  - Prevent denial-of-service and Sybil attacks by enforcing per-client rate limits.
  - Require relay and server nodes to authenticate before joining the network.
- Key rotation and signing
  - Implement regular key rotation for relay and server certificates.
  - Sign relay binaries so clients can verify integrity before connecting.
- Content moderation hooks
  - Provide optional server-side hooks for filtering malicious prompts or responses after
    decryption.
  - Document best practices for keeping moderation logic separate from relay code to preserve
    privacy.
- Environment-aware logging
  - Disable verbose logs in production and strip connection metadata where possible.
  - Offer an audit mode that can be enabled temporarily for debugging incidents.
- External security review
  - Engage third-party auditors to review the protocol and codebase.
  - Publish findings and follow up with patches to maintain community trust.

These recommendations build on the existing security log in the `token.place` repository and aim to
mitigate relay compromise, malicious server nodes, and network-level attacks.
