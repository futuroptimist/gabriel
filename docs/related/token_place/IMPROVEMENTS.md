# Token.place Security Improvement Suggestions

This document summarizes potential enhancements for the `token.place` project based on our analysis
of its architecture and threat model. The goal is to strengthen relay and server node security while
preserving the privacy-first design.

## Current Snapshot (2025-09-29)

- **Status:** âœ… on the Futuroptimist related projects roster (refreshed 2025-09-29 05:02 UTC).
- **Stack:** FastAPI- and asyncio-driven Python services, Electron desktop client, and TypeScript
  utilities orchestrated via Makefile scripts and GitHub Actions.
- **Conventions:** Prompts now live under `docs/prompts/codex/`, outages under `outages/`, and
  tests wrap both crypto compatibility and full relay flows.
- **Security delta:** Prompt docs were renamed for clarity; no runtime changes landed, but the
  documentation move helps agents avoid stale automation scripts.
- **Watchlist:** Continue monitoring crypto dependencies (`cryptography`, `pyNaCl`, `tweetnacl`
  bindings) and the optional desktop updater path.

## Recommended Improvements

- Rate limiting and authentication
  - Prevent denial-of-service and Sybil attacks by enforcing per-client rate limits.
  - Require relay and server nodes to authenticate before joining the network.
- Key rotation and signing
  - Implement regular key rotation for relay and server certificates.
  - Sign relay binaries so clients can verify integrity before connecting.
- Content moderation hooks
  - Provide optional server-side hooks for filtering malicious prompts or responses after
    decryption.
  - Document best practices for keeping moderation logic separate from relay code to preserve
    privacy.
- Environment-aware logging
  - Disable verbose logs in production and strip connection metadata where possible.
  - Offer an audit mode that can be enabled temporarily for debugging incidents.
- External security review
  - Engage third-party auditors to review the protocol and codebase.
  - Publish findings and follow up with patches to maintain community trust.

These recommendations build on the existing security log in the `token.place` repository and aim to
mitigate relay compromise, malicious server nodes, and network-level attacks.
