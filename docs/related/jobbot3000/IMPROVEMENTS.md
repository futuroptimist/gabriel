# Suggested Improvements for jobbot3000

This document records enhancements for the
[futuroptimist/jobbot3000](https://github.com/futuroptimist/jobbot3000) repository.

## Current Snapshot (2025-09-29)

- **Status:** âœ… on the Futuroptimist roster.
- **Stack:** Node.js CLI with rich documentation, ESLint configs, and jest-style test suites.
- **Conventions:** Prompt docs live under `docs/prompts/codex/`, scripts orchestrate chore prompts,
  and resume pipelines ensure deliverables bundle PDFs.
- **Security delta:** PR #717 ensured resume bundles always include `resume.pdf`, updated docs, and
  added workflows for CI and CodeQL, expanding automation reliance on PATs.
- **Watchlist:** Monitor the growing `bin/jobbot.js` CLI for dependency injection risks and keep
  deliverable exporters sanitizing personal data.

## Improvement Themes

- [ ] Document safe storage for transcripts and cover letters generated by the CLI.
- [ ] Add integration tests covering CodeQL workflow fallback scenarios.
- [ ] Provide guidance for air-gapped resume generation when tokens cannot leave secure hosts.
