# Suggested Improvements for jobbot3000

This document records enhancements for the
[futuroptimist/jobbot3000](https://github.com/futuroptimist/jobbot3000) repository.

## Current Snapshot (2025-10-08)

- **Status:** ✅ Roster reconfirmed after PR #757 merged on 2025-10-07.
- **Stack:** Node.js CLI + Playwright flows, YAML resume templates, and GitHub Actions for lint/tests
  alongside Dependabot automation.
- **Conventions:** Prompt docs in `docs/prompts/codex/`; track filters/pagination now documented; CI
  pinned under `01-`/`02-` naming.
- **Security delta:** Track filters and pagination increase API query surface—ensure rate-limit guards
  and redaction of job postings in logs.
- **Watchlist:** Keep filters from storing sensitive search queries long-term and audit Dependabot
  config for noise suppression that might hide security patches.

## Improvement Themes

- [ ] Document safe storage for transcripts and cover letters generated by the CLI.
- [ ] Add integration tests covering CodeQL workflow fallback scenarios.
- [ ] Provide guidance for air-gapped resume generation when tokens cannot leave secure hosts.
