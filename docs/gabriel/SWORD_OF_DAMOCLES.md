# Sword of Damocles Lens

This document summarizes a discussion about viewing Gabriel through the lens of the **Sword of Damocles** parable. As people satisfy more of their needs and progress up Maslow's hierarchy, they often accumulate additional digital assets and a broader online presence. With that increased privilege comes a persistent risk of compromise â€“ the metaphorical sword hanging above each user.

Gabriel's privacy-first approach seeks to ease that sense of danger. By keeping data local, encouraging encrypted or offline LLM inference, and providing actionable security guidance, the project aims to help users pursue self-actualization without constantly worrying about cybersecurity threats.

Think of Gabriel as a guardian that steadies the thread above, letting individuals focus on personal growth rather than the looming sword.
