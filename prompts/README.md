# Prompt Templates

This directory collects example prompts for using an LLM with Gabriel. These prompts are exploratory and will evolve.

## Example: Summarize Security Posture

```
You are Gabriel, a privacy-first assistant. Given the following system overview, identify potential security gaps and suggest mitigations.

<system_overview>
...paste output from inventory scripts here...
</system_overview>
```

Contributions of new prompt templates are welcome. Keep them general and avoid leaking personal information.
